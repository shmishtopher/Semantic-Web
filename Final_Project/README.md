AUTO is an interactive command line tool for
matching you to a car.  AUTO presents an intuitive
question-based interface that lets you search
through thousands of cars for potential matches.

Currently, AUTO will ask for:
- Make
- city MPG
- highway MPG
- hybrid status
- horsepower

All of these feilds are optional, and the application
will dynamically generate the appropriate query.
Nummeric values are lower bounds, so the application
will filter for cars with equal or greater magnitudes.
