## NASA Patent Search Engine
This application pulls an RDF graph from (https://data.nasa.gov/api/views/gquh-watm/rows.rdf")[https://data.nasa.gov/api/views/gquh-watm/rows.rdf"] and presents an intuitive user interface for querying the graph across multiple fields.  It currently implements interfaces to search by patent number and title keywords.  Both of these query types implement "partial matching," which means that the user only needs to know part of the patent number or a handful of keywords to find what they are searching for. For example, entering "737" while in patent mode will return results for 7371358, 7375826, 7378962, and 7290737.  This same system also works for keywords when in title mode.  The application supports switching between modes by entering special commands into the search bar.  Currently, these are "@q", "@p", and "@t" for (Q)uit, (P)atent mode, and (T)itle mode.  This application has a variety of uses.  For example, a litigant may use the database to check on the status of patents held by NASA.  An individual or organization may find this interface more ergonomic than crawling through endless CSV files to find the same information.
